# apt_assignment_3

The assignment is about implementing a two-player text-based version of the board game Scrabble. The assignment will require students to practice programming skills such as ADTs, linked lists, pointers, dynamic memory management, file processing, program state management, and exception handling. The assignment is divided into four milestones. Milestones 1 and 2 involve developing a fully functioning implementation of the base Scrabble game play, while Milestone 3 involves extending upon the implementation with additional functionality. The final Milestone 4 involves submitting a written report and demonstration of the software design and implementation, and use of test cases. The implemented enhancements for this assignment include the --dictionary, --hint, and --ai features, for which classes such as WordBuilder, Word, GreedyMap, Dictionary, and AdjacentTile were implemented. 

The enchancements implemented are 

* --dictionary
* --hint
* --ai

The possible combination of the enhancements is:
* --dictionary
* --hint
* --ai
* --hint --ai

When --ai or --hint is configured, the program automatically loads --dictionary. 

Please run the executable and type in 5 in the menu to learn more about what the ai is capable of.
